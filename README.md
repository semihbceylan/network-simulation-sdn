##Network Coverage Simulation for Natural Disaster Scenarios##
This project is a simulation tool designed to aid in the management and recovery of communication systems after natural disasters, such as earthquakes. The tool provides a graphical interface where users can place antennas on a map and visualize the connections between network nodes that are within the antennas' effective range.

#Features#
Graphical User Interface (GUI):
A user-friendly interface that allows users to place antennas on a map, visualize their coverage, and simulate communication networks.

Antenna Placement:
Users can interactively place antennas at various locations. The application calculates the coverage area for each antenna based on predefined parameters.

Network Connectivity Visualization:
Nodes within the effective range of an antenna are connected via edges, showing the network links dynamically as antennas are placed or moved.

Customizable Parameters:
Users can adjust parameters such as antenna range, power, and frequency to simulate different network conditions and disaster scenarios.

#Use Case#
In the event of a natural disaster like an earthquake, communication infrastructure often suffers damage, resulting in coverage gaps. This tool helps simulate the placement of antennas (e.g., base stations, mobile towers) to provide optimal network coverage in such situations. It can be used by network operators, emergency management teams, and researchers working on post-disaster communication systems.
